my watch fell in the water
prevailing wind from the east
breathing is difficult
I can see the rings on Saturn
physics and chemistry are hard
my bank account is overdrawn
elections bring out the best
we are having spaghetti
time to go shopping
a problem with the engine
elephants are afraid of mice
my favorite place to visit
three two one zero blast off
circumstances are unacceptable
if at first you do not succeed
we run the risk of failure
prayer in schools offends some
he is just like everyone else
great disturbance in the force
love means many things
you must be getting old
the world is a stage
can I skate with sister today
one heck of a question
question that must be answered
